# 📘 Placement: Importance of Coding Round Problems and easy methods to solve those problems easily (Java Focus)

## 🚀 Overview
The coding round is a critical stage in placement processes for tech roles. It evaluates a candidate’s ability to solve algorithmic problems using programming languages like **Java**.

## 🧠 What It Tests
- Core Java concepts (OOP, Collections, Exception Handling)
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
- Problem-solving and logic
- Code efficiency and optimization

## 💼 Why It Matters
- Acts as the **first major elimination round**
- Determines your **technical foundation**
- Used by top recruiters: TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, etc.
- A high score here boosts chances for interview calls

## 📝 Sample Java Snippet
```java
// Sample: Reverse a String
public class ReverseString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "placement";
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(input);
        System.out.println(sb.reverse().toString());
    }
}
